My attempt on making the game 2048 with HTML, CSS, JS with mobile input as well!

### SO FAR
- Includes startup animation onload 
  - And when the user presses 'New Game'
- Displays a 4 by 4 grid that implements two blocks
  - These blocks are either '2' or '4' onto grid
- Includes a link to my Github bottom right of the site!
